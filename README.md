# Electrochemistry
This repository gives some tools to simulate voltammetry experiments for a range of electrochemistry-chemical coupled reactions. The well known E, EC, CE and ECE mechanisms are described.
This four mechanisms are simultated with a Cranck Nicholson Scheme as they are only first order chemical reactions involved.
For these mechanisms differents galvanostatic experiments can be performed : Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Cyclic Staircase Voltammetry (CSV), Chronamperometry, Square Wave Voltammetry (SWV).

The simulations are made under the assumption that there is no ohmic drop in solution, that the faradic currents are negligible, that there is no adsorpiton at the electrodes and that the diffusion regime is allmost infinite in space.
